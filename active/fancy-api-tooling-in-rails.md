As somebody who's built APIs with PHP since 2009, and built APIs with Rails for the last two years, the contrast in some of the tooling available is mind-blowing. When it comes to factories for generating test data, spec-driven testing with tools like RSpec, mutation testing, simplistic state machines, serialization and deserialization in JSON-API, REPL debugging with breakpoints, file upload handlers, etc., Ruby (and Rails) very often has a strong lead in maturity of the tooling.

Objectively speaking, PHP either does not have some of these tools, or they're immature in comparison. This is by no means a fault of PHP as a language or a community. Ruby has had Gems for far longer than PHP has had Composer, and while PHP is starting to learn how to get this done in a post-framework-everything world, it has a way to go.

This talk looks at some of the cool stuff Ruby can do, and some of the lesser known tools that provide similar functionality in PHP.
