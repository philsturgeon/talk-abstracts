Some talks about APIs will argue what it is to be truly RESTful. Some will go
on and on about the correct status codes, or the right methods. Many of these
talks will not explain what can go wrong if you use the wrong stuff, but this
one will.

- How to stop Google deleting everything in your API
- Avoid people downloading your entire dataset and putting you out of business
- Don't get stuck using a two year old RC build of JSON-API forever due to busted development workflows
- How to respect error messages on the client side so people don't rage quit the app
- Avoid letting pagination be a DDoS vector
- Avoid letting includes be a DDoS vector and generally a PITA
- Stop your services from lying to each other
- Avoid showing cached errors to other users

All this and more, in a treasure-trove of "this can go wrong so don't do it"
advice, picked up from years of working on APIs and sharing tales of woe with
other API-folk.
