## Anti-Nonsense

I have recommended RPC, REST _and_ GraphQL for different services at WeWork in the last few months.

GraphQL is a newer concept, being released by Facebook publicly in 2015.

---

REST was a dissertation published by Roy Fielding in 2000, popularized kinda by companies like Twitter in 2006.

---

This article uses the term REST as defined in Roy Fielding's dissertation, RESTish to mean it's somewhere on the Richardson Maturity Model but didn't make it to the top, and endpoint-based APIs to mean any REST/RESTish/RPC/etc. API that uses endpoints instead of POSTing to a single /graphql endpoint.

A lot of people are over-hyping GraphQL for qualities that REST APIs have too, which is annoying.

Many of these ideas were taken _from_ REST, which is awesome.

Share ideas around, learn and benefit from all.

---

Time Wasting

Rebuilding stuff for one thing, which you could have in REST is wasteful

---

Brain Washing

Switching just becauase hype or cool is a drug you gotta quit

---

1. REST and GraphQL are totally different

2. GraphQL isn't a magic bullet, nor is it "better"

3. You can definitely use both at the same time

4. GraphQL is dope if used for the right thing

---

REST is an architectural concept for network-based software, has no official set of tools, has no specification, doesn't care if you use HTTP, AMQP, etc., and is designed to decouple an API from the client. The focus is on making APIs last for decades, instead of optimizing for performance.

---

GraphQL is a query language, specification, and collection of tools, designed to operate over a single endpoint via HTTP, optimizing for performance and flexibility.

---

## Remember FQL?

```
GET /fql?q=SELECT%2Buid2%2BFROM%2Bfriend%2BWHERE%2Buid1%3Dme()&access_token=...
```

Facebook didn't like FQL _and_ RESTish so they combined it

???
Most of us would never even consider using FQL

---

One of the main tenants of REST is to utilize the uniform interface of the protocols it exists in. When utilizing HTTP, REST can leverage HTTP content-types, caching, status codes, etc., whereas GraphQL invents its own conventions.

---

basic show off how graphql works

SLIDE WITH SHIT CIRCLED like without HATEOAS RESTISH

---

background-image: url(img/hypermedia-like-no-handlebars.jpg)

# REST /wo HATEOAS = RESTish

---

Everyone thinks RESTish is REST

---

Comparing RESTish to GraphQL is daft

---

```
RESTish = (REST - HATEOAS + HTTP + (OData | (JSON Schema + JSON-API)) )

GraphQL == RESTish
```

If your API is not using HATEOAS and you dont want to stitch together a bunch of best practices then GraphQL = A++ (Repeat later)

---

Packaged together in one beautiful website

Compare two websites... easy to see why one feels like a modern replacement for an old idea

---

Basically GraphQL is a special type of RPC

Mutations are very definitively RPC and the queries is like a default GET with params

GraphQL encourages tight Coupling between client-server, making them quicker (dont need more requests) but fragile

---

If your API is not using HATEOAS and you dont want to stitch together a bunch of best practices then GraphQL = A++

Tight Coupling...

???
Need a LOT of developers
Amazing docs + automated testing

---

RESTish &amp; GraphQL are both about Tight Coupling

---

HATEOAS intends to avoid tight coupling
