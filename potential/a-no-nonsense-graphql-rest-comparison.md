title: A No Nonsense GraphQL and REST Comparison
category: api
tags: graphql, rest
---

GraphQL is incorrectly considered by some to be a "replacement" to REST. GraphQL is a newer concept, being released by Facebook publicly in 2015, whereas REST was a dissertation published by Roy Fielding in 2000, popularized by companies like Twitter (quite inaccurately) in 2006.
This article aims to cover a few notable differences, and make the following points:

1. REST and GraphQL are totally different
2. GraphQL isn't a magic bullet, nor is it "better"
3. You can definitely use both at the same time
4. GraphQL is dope if used for the right thing

### Notes

Based off of the articles here:

Not sure if its entry/mid/advanced, etc, I keep language simple so everyone should understand what im talking about, but if they dont know anything about APIs this probably isnt for them.
