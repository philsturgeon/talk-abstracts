It is becoming ever more common for server-side developers to build APIs thanks to the rise of front-end JavaScript 
frameworks, iPhone applications and generally API-centric architectures. Grabbing data source and shoving it out as 
JSON sounds easy, but there is so much more. Surviving changes in business logic, database schema updates, using 
serialization to avoid directly outputting database structure, JSON-API and loads more.

This talk like many other API talks starts off talking about some pretty basic concepts, but walks through to the tougher 
stuff. We'll keep life interesting with some horror stories from my own adventures, and from those of my friends in
start-up/API land. Learn from our mistakes, our experiences, and have a chuckle while you're at it.
