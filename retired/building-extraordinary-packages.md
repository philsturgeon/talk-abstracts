Back in the day, we had PEAR packages. These were often very well written, but
due to PEARs lack of popularity we ended up just using mega-frameworks and
writing bundles, modules, cells and sparks for that framework. Since then
Composer has been a bit of a savior, but the way in which we make these packages
is still new and scary.

There are a lot of talks about building good code, and writing OOP well, but how
do you make a Composer package that is as high in quality as you can? Things
like SemVer, avoiding NIH syndrome verses knowing WHEN to fork or make a new
package, responsible deprecation and loads more.

The League of Extraordinary Packages is a group of developers who have banded
together to build solid, well tested PHP packages using modern coding standards.
The name might be a little silly, but the group dedicates itself to active
maintenance, handing over projects when a lead has to step aside, working
together and an absolute dedication to following and supporting standards.
