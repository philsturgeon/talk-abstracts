Nobody out there thinks you should always use REST for every single API being built, nor should you ever use any one paradigm for everything, but a growing number of people misunderstand REST so badly they think they never need it.

As with most things, there is a whole bunch of nuance that the average developer doesn't have time to consider when they're trying to get their job done, but some of that busyness can come from solving problems that popped up because the wrong paradigm was being used in the first place.

REST can be considered a bunch of layers of abstraction that help you talk to the client developers less, whilst enabling them to build more sturdy and consistent applications. This talk walks through each of those layers, and explains the benefits each one can provide in certain situations.
