Being a developer for years its very easy to get type-cast. You become "The CodeIgniter Guy", the one dev in the office that knows how FooCMS works or just end up farming out CRUD day after day. Well I decided to say "nope" to that & accepted a job where I'd need to know how to doâ€¦everything.

At Kapture I've been using new software & devops methodologies to create & build a versioned API with PHP & Laravel to serve an iPhone application & multiple web applications, one of which is built using EmberJS. I've used multiple Chef provisioned AWS instances behind Elastic Load Balancers, mixed MySQL with Riak, used Behat, Faker & Jenkins to test everything, set up Logstash & Graylog2 to store all of our various log files, installed Graphite to track version usage & all sorts of other metrics and Python with RabbitMQ to offload everything to the backend.

This talk aims to give you an overview of what you should be looking to learn next if you want to stop being "just a developer" & move into the devops/architecture arena.
