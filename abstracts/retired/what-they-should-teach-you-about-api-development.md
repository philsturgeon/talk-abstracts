As a refinement to his previously published book, the author of "Building APIs
You Won't Hate" found that API books and training tend to introduce
documentation, hypermedia and testing as an after-thought, as if these are not
important. However, some new experiences have shown that API development works
best when these items are thought out first, as well as including a strong
pragmatic approach to ensure the API solves real problems without getting stuck
on the theory of how to "properly" create it.

Other pragmatic talking points include: Why and how documentation first can stop
your team(s) from getting violent, when is REST not what you want, why is
hypermedia sometimes a distraction, convenient ways to avoid versions in your
API or at least postpone it, and comprehensive but simple endpoint integration
testing beyond trivial examples.
