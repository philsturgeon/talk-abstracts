API Description Documents (a.k.a "specifications") revolutionize every phase of the API
lifecycle, so we're going to blast through the whole thing. Hold onto your butts.

- Use beautiful GUI designers to get started planning your API before any code gets written
- Create mocks from those descriptions and share em around to get feedback before you waste any time coding
- Implement Spectral to enforce a style guide for your descriptions so they can be high quality
- Do everything in git so once mock gets a thumbs up, there is a papertrail for any big changes
- Use those descriptions as contract tests as you develop to make sure you're coding it right
- Use the descriptions to power your HTTP request validation to avoid rewriting all that stuff
- Spit out the descriptions as docs for anyone who needs them
